# Complaint Management System

This is the advanced version of complaint management system. Its Basic Project without ORM and migration can be found at https://github.com/muhammadhuzaifakhan1133/flask_fifth_assignment. In this project I use:
1. **flask** [for Restful APIs]
2. **flask-sqlalchemy** [for ORM]
3. **alembic** [for migration]

For Migration:
* Use **alembic revision --autogenerate -m "migration name"** for make migrations
* Use **alembic upgrade head** for migrate
